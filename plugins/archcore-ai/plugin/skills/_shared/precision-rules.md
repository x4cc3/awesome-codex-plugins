# Precision Rules — Forbidden Lexicon and Authoring Conventions

Plugin runtime asset. Loaded by skills (`decide`, `capture`) before
composing documents of type `adr`, `spec`, `rule`, `guide`. See also
`skills/_shared/adr-contract.md`.

## Rules

1. **Forbidden vagueness lexicon.** New documents and updates MUST NOT introduce
   these words: `appropriate`, `robust`, `scalable`, `modern`, `best practices`,
   `various`, `as needed`, `optimal`, `efficient`, `flexible`, `convenient`,
   `seamless`, `streamlined`, `world-class`, `cutting-edge`, `оптимальный`,
   `удобный`, `правильный`, `надёжный`, `гибкий`, `современный`, `передовой`,
   `эффективный`, `масштабируемый`. Replace with a concrete fact, version,
   threshold, or measured outcome. Existing occurrences in pre-existing
   documents are not flagged.

2. **Imperative phrasing in normative sections.** Documents of type `rule`,
   `spec`, and any contract document MUST use `MUST` / `MUST NOT` / `MAY` for
   prescriptive statements. Narrative phrasing ("we should", "it is recommended",
   "следует") is forbidden in those sections. Other sections (Rationale,
   Examples, Context) MAY use narrative voice.

3. **`[assumption]` marker.** When a technical claim cannot be grounded in
   existing code, prior measurement, or external authority, it MUST be marked
   `[assumption]` inline at the start of the claim or sentence. Vision-stage
   documents (idea, prd, plan, mrd, brd, urd) MAY contain many such markers;
   decision-stage documents (adr, spec, rule) SHOULD contain few.

4. **Falsifiable claims.** Performance, scale, reliability, and behavior claims
   MUST include a measured value with units and a measurement context
   (`p99 < 200ms at 1000 rps, load profile L2`) OR be marked `[assumption]`.
   Adjective-only claims (`fast`, `scalable`, `low-latency`) without a
   measurement are forbidden.

5. **No cross-document body sections.** Documents MUST NOT contain a body
   section that enumerates other `.archcore/` documents — for example
   `## Related Documents`, `## Related Resources`, `## Related Materials`,
   `## References` listing ADRs/RFCs/rules/guides, or `### Related Artifacts`
   listing archcore docs. Cross-document links live exclusively in the
   relation graph, managed by `mcp__archcore__add_relation` and queried via
   `mcp__archcore__list_relations`.

   The body MAY cite:
   - source code via `@path/to/file` notation (`@internal/mcp/server.go`)
   - commits, PRs, dashboards, metrics, runbooks
   - external authorities (RFCs, papers, vendor docs, blog posts)
   - the document's own enforcement artifacts (lint rules, CI checks)

   Rationale: the relation graph is the single source of truth for
   cross-document links. Duplicating them in body markdown causes drift when
   relations change, hides structure that callers can already query, and
   pollutes prose with plumbing that belongs in metadata.

## Examples

### Good

- "PostgreSQL 16.2 on RDS db.r7g.xlarge — chosen because the team needs
  `pg_advisory_lock` (used in the scheduler module's distributed-lock helper)."
- "Authentication MUST verify JWT signature using ES256. [assumption] Token
  rotation will be 24h pending security review."
- "Reduces p99 latency from 4.2s to <80ms under load profile L2 (Grafana
  dashboard #42, 2024-03-15)."
- "MUST NOT call this function from within a transaction — it acquires its
  own connection."
- "Implementation lives in `@internal/mcp/server.go`; conformance tests in
  `@internal/mcp/server_test.go`."

### Bad

- "Chose a robust, scalable database appropriate for our needs."
- "Authentication should be reliable and modern."
- "Significantly improves performance under load."
- "It is recommended to use the helper for convenience."
- A `## Related Documents` section listing `.archcore/auth/popup/architecture.doc.md`
  and `.archcore/auth/popup/component-interaction.rule.md` — those links
  belong in the relation graph (`mcp__archcore__add_relation`), not in the
  body.

6. **Architect voice: expert, concise, precise, argued.** Documents are
   decision records and context maps — not implementation walkthroughs. The
   target quality is: a senior engineer reads it in 30 seconds and knows
   *why* this exists, *what* was decided, and *what it costs*. Verbose
   AI-padded prose that restates the obvious is a defect.

   **Use freely:**
   - `@path/to/file` references, commit hashes, PR links, issue numbers
   - Inline code for identifiers, function names, type names, version strings,
     CLI flags — anything that names a concrete artifact
   - Measurements, thresholds, SLOs, dates — exact values beat adjectives

   **Avoid:**
   - Pasting function bodies or multi-line code blocks where a `@reference`
     would suffice — the source file is readable; the document is not its copy
   - Filler phrases ("This document describes...", "In summary, we can see...")
   - Generic implementation detail that adds no architectural signal

   **Code blocks belong** in types where the exact textual format IS the
   artifact: `rule` (Good/Bad examples), `guide` (terminal steps), `cpat`
   (Before/After). Also appropriate in any type when the user explicitly
   requests them or when the format itself is normative (wire protocol,
   config schema, CLI interface).

   This default applies to: `adr`, `rfc`, `doc`, `prd`, `idea`, `plan`, `mrd`,
   `brd`, `urd`, `brs`, `strs`, `syrs`, `srs`.

## Enforcement

- The plugin's `bin/check-precision` PostToolUse hook detects forbidden lexicon
  words in newly created documents and (in later phases) in additions during
  `update_document`. Findings are emitted as `additionalContext`. The hook never
  blocks (always exits 0).
- Skills load this asset and the relevant contract before composition.
