# Staff Engineer Mode

Staff Engineer Mode gives your coding agent production instincts. It turns
major-outage writeups, reliability practice, security guidance, and release
lessons into routed specialists for architecture, reliability, security,
delivery, and operations. It puts hard-won production judgment in the path of
everyday coding work.

## Sources

Every outage case study here is built on a primary incident record: AWS
post-event summaries, Azure post-incident reviews, Google Cloud and Google
Workspace incident reports, Meta's outage writeups, and Netflix's AWS-outage
analysis.

The broader practices rest on first-party engineering sources: Amazon's
Builders' Library, Google's SRE books and Software Engineering at Google, Meta
Engineering, Microsoft's SDL and DevOps guidance, Apple's security and privacy
documentation, and Netflix's resilience work. Standards and guidance come from
NIST, CISA, OWASP, OpenSSF, IETF, and W3C.

See the [source index](skills/_shared/references/source-index.md) for the full
reference set. Staff Engineer Mode is independent and is not endorsed by or
affiliated with these organizations.

## How It Works

Ask a normal engineering question. Hand the agent a task, design, diff,
incident, rollout, or maintenance problem. The router picks one specialist
(occasionally one secondary), reads that file, and returns concrete decisions,
risks, checks, owners, supporting details, and next steps. You never name a
specialist.

Supported tools should list only the native `staff-engineer-mode` router.
Specialist files live under `specialists/` and load only after routing. The
router picks one primary specialist by default.

For commits and amends, Staff Engineer Mode calls `agent-pr-review` against
the exact staged diff. For releases, tags, version bumps, packages, artifacts,
and promotions, it calls `release-build-reproducibility` and
`production-readiness-review` together.

## Installation

Commands labeled "terminal" are run in your shell. Commands labeled "agent
chat" are typed inside that tool's interactive agent session.

### Claude Code

Terminal:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/sirmarkz/staff-engineer-mode.git
claude plugin install staff-engineer-mode@staff-engineer-mode
```

Agent chat:

```text
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/sirmarkz/staff-engineer-mode.git
```

```text
/plugin install staff-engineer-mode@staff-engineer-mode
```

### Codex

Terminal:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/sirmarkz/staff-engineer-mode.git
codex plugin add staff-engineer-mode@staff-engineer-mode
```

### Cursor

Terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sirmarkz/staff-engineer-mode.git ~/.cursor/staff-engineer-mode-src
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/plugins
ln -s ~/.cursor/staff-engineer-mode-src ~/.cursor/plugins/staff-engineer-mode
```

### OpenCode

Terminal:

```bash
opencode plugin 'staff-engineer-mode@git+https://github.com/sirmarkz/staff-engineer-mode.git'
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

Terminal:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add https://github.com/sirmarkz/staff-engineer-mode.git
```

Install the plugin:

```bash
copilot plugin install staff-engineer-mode@staff-engineer-mode
```

### Gemini CLI

Terminal:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/sirmarkz/staff-engineer-mode
```

## Verify

Start a fresh session inside any open repo and ask one of:

- "Before implementing partner webhooks, design delivery retries, replay, and dead-letter handling."
- "For a new inventory dependency call, decide timeout, retry, and fallback."
- "Review my last commit."

The agent should load the router, choose one specialist, and respond with concrete decisions, risks, checks, owners, supporting details, and next steps.

## What's Inside

One native router skill: `staff-engineer-mode`. It routes to 64 specialist
files under `specialists/`; those files are not installed or listed as separate
native skills.
