# Routing Matrix Notes

## Decision Frame

1. Identify the requested artifact: decision, design, plan, readiness check, rollout, investigation, runbook, migration, eval, control pack, or diff review.
2. Identify the work phase: ideation, design, development, testing, pre-merge, launch, migration, active incident, post-incident, regression, readiness, or steady-state maintenance.
3. Identify the dominant risk: availability, latency, durability, correctness, security, privacy, compatibility, operator load, cost, release safety, or customer experience.
4. Route to one primary. Add a secondary only when the user explicitly asks for a separate artifact.
5. Infer missing artifact, phase, surface, and risk from prompt, repo, files, branch context, and conversation; withhold routing only when no in-scope engineering lifecycle/control frame exists.

## Exact Slug Guardrails

Return the canonical `specialists/<slug>.md` slug, not a semantic alias.

- Fault-domain topology, static failover capacity, location-loss survivability, and availability assumptions are `high-availability-design`; chaos tests, game days, failover drills, and fault injection are `resilience-experiments`.
- New API surfaces, operation/resource shape, generated-client ergonomics, existing-client callers, backwards compatibility, and safe deprecation of an exposed API response field are `api-design-and-compatibility`, not broad migration.
- RTO/RPO, backup, restore, corruption, accidental deletion, or DR restore tests are `backup-and-recovery`, not backup/restore aliases.
- Showing that a controlled failure test itself is safe and scoped is `resilience-experiments`; showing that the topology has enough already-available capacity under domain loss is `high-availability-design`.
- Downstream dependency calls, retries, timeouts, idempotency, duplicate work, and overload behavior are `dependency-resilience`, unless the prompt is mainly event replay, ordering, or DLQ behavior.
- Designing or building state machines, protocol correctness, locking, concurrency, invariants, property tests, fuzzing, simulation, or model checking are `state-machine-correctness`.
- Production config changes, generated operations, bulk scripts, validation, preview, blast-radius limits, abort paths, or rollback before mutation are `configuration-and-automation-safety`, not config aliases.
- Runtime configuration drift and temporary overrides that need owners, expiry, validation, or rollback before automation applies them are `configuration-and-automation-safety`; desired-state capture, drift detection, reconciliation, and emergency exception rules after manual infrastructure changes are `infrastructure-and-policy-as-code`.
- Generic code-review purpose, change-size limits, ownership, review latency, and workflow metrics have no routed specialist unless a concrete engineering surface is present; one concrete pre-merge diff review is `agent-pr-review`.
- A concrete diff, branch, PR, or last-commit review stays with `agent-pr-review` even when the prompt says tests pass, changed behavior needs verification, or edge cases may be missing; test strategy without a concrete diff is `testing-and-quality-gates`.
- A deprecation PR, sunset change, or removal diff that asks for no-new-usage checks, migration controls, or backsliding prevention routes to `migration-and-deprecation`, not `agent-pr-review`.
- Static-analysis backlogs, warning ratchets, dead-code cleanup, and maintenance-risk prioritization route to `dependency-and-code-hygiene` even when changed files are available; changed files alone do not make the request a pre-merge diff review.
- The word "review" is not enough to select `agent-pr-review`: design review, security review, API review, data review, rollout review, or test review without a concrete diff routes by the engineering surface.
- A surface-specific change before merge still routes to the narrow surface specialist when the requested artifact is compatibility, safety, rollout, security, accessibility, data, or test results rather than a general diff verdict.
- Dependency updates, lockfile sweeps, migration notes, rollback risks, and small-batch hygiene are `dependency-and-code-hygiene`, even when packaged as a PR.
- On-call suppression rules, noisy pages, responder load, toil, and checking that page reduction does not hide user impact are `oncall-health`; new alert design remains `observability-and-alerting`.
- Cross-service distributed-data locks tied to consistency, failover, conflicts, or replication lag are `distributed-data-and-consistency`; local protocol invariants remain `state-machine-correctness`.
- Event message producer/consumer replay, ordering, idempotency, and DLQ behavior are `event-workflows`; shared schema compatibility alone is `data-contracts`.
- Derived search indexes, materialized views, cache invalidation, and stale-result freshness are `caching-and-derived-data`; batch or streaming pipeline freshness is `data-pipeline-reliability`.
- Query plans, schema migrations, indexes, backfills, locks, and database-caused endpoint regressions are `database-operations`; general hot-path or capacity regressions are `performance-and-capacity`.
- Database migration execution is `database-operations`; if the same prompt separately asks for future blocking checks against incompatible schema changes, add `testing-and-quality-gates` as the secondary.
- Threat models, trust boundaries, data flows, abuse cases, and residual-risk registers are `secure-sdlc-and-threat-modeling`, not threat-modeling aliases.
- Source-to-deploy trust, isolated builders, provenance, signing, deployment admission, or untrusted artifact risk are `software-supply-chain-security`.
- Deployed vulnerabilities, exploitability, exposure, patch SLAs, remediation rollout, and expiring exceptions are `vulnerability-management`.
- Model-serving promotion, eval thresholds, training-serving skew, drift monitors, model rollback, and model endpoint replacement checks are `ml-reliability-and-evaluation`; broad launch readiness without ML risk is `production-readiness-review`.
- Internal service-to-service routing, discovery, locality, identity, and private dependency traffic policy are `internal-service-networking`; dependency version cleanup is `dependency-and-code-hygiene`.
- AI coding-agent repo rules, protected paths, required tests, data boundaries, and generated-code acceptance checks are `ai-coding-governance`.
- LLM eval harnesses, datasets, graders, thresholds, slice coverage, and regression history are `llm-evaluation`.

## High-Risk Boundaries

- Reliability targets, SLO-based alert tuning, and urgent/follow-up rules route to `slo-and-error-budgets`; telemetry construction routes to `observability-and-alerting`; alert fatigue routes to `oncall-health`.
- When a prompt mixes noisy pages and missing reliability targets, route the immediate operator pain to `oncall-health` and use `slo-and-error-budgets` only as a secondary policy artifact.
- Launch readiness routes to `production-readiness-review` only when launch, major traffic shift, impact increase, or broad readiness checks are explicit. Generic design decisions route elsewhere.
- Active incident command, live mitigation, and postmortem authorship route to `incident-response-and-postmortems` before root-cause specialty work.
- Newer narrow routes beat broad neighbors when their artifact is present: config/automation safety, documentation lifecycle, data contracts, accessibility checks, AI coding controls, agent PR review, LLM eval, experimentation guardrails, fleet upgrades, cryptography/key lifecycle, feature flag lifecycle, LLM serving cost and latency, code readability for agents, test data engineering, and dev environment parity.
- Fault-domain topology routes to `high-availability-design`; restore capability routes to `backup-and-recovery`; controlled failure tests route to `resilience-experiments`.
- Release cutting, release trains/candidates, build and artifact creation, packaging, and promotion mechanics route to `release-build-reproducibility`; production exposure and rollback route to `progressive-delivery`.
- Config, feature settings, generated operations, and automation mutation route to `configuration-and-automation-safety`; production exposure still routes to `progressive-delivery`.
- Rollout and rollback plans for any production-affecting change, including config, schema, data, or client changes, route to `progressive-delivery`; one-shot mutation without staged exposure stays with `configuration-and-automation-safety`.
- Declarative infrastructure changes with policy checks, drift detection, and reconciliation route to `infrastructure-and-policy-as-code`; ad-hoc config or automation runs against production state stay with `configuration-and-automation-safety`.
- Engineering docs route to `documentation-lifecycle` only when responsibility, source of truth, freshness, operational accuracy, lifecycle checks, or stale/missing guidance are the artifact. Routine editorial or mechanical documentation maintenance should be handled directly without a Staff Engineer Mode specialist. Architecture decisions still route to `architecture-decisions`.
- Normal merge/release checks route to `testing-and-quality-gates`; protocol, state-machine, or concurrency assurance routes to `state-machine-correctness`.
- Accessibility conformance for user-facing flows routes to `accessibility-gates`; client performance still routes to `web-release-gates` or `mobile-release-engineering`.
- Broad migrations, legacy retirement, and capability sunset route to `migration-and-deprecation`; routine cleanup routes to `dependency-and-code-hygiene`; new or changed exposed API contracts route to `api-design-and-compatibility`.
- Fleet upgrades, support windows, and mixed-version rollout route to `fleet-upgrades`; routine package updates stay with `dependency-and-code-hygiene`.
- Supply-chain trust controls route to `software-supply-chain-security`; deployed vulnerability remediation routes to `vulnerability-management`; routine dependency updates route to `dependency-and-code-hygiene`.
- Pre-deploy abuse-case and control reasoning routes to `secure-sdlc-and-threat-modeling`; already-deployed vulnerable code routes to `vulnerability-management`; trust in the build path routes to `software-supply-chain-security`.
- Cryptographic agility, certificate expiry, key rotation, and trust-chain lifecycle route to `cryptography-and-key-lifecycle`; runtime access and secrets policy stays with `identity-and-secrets`.
- Post-rollout feature-flag inventory, expiry, fallback behavior, removal plans, and orphan flag debt route to `feature-flag-lifecycle`; introducing the flag during rollout stays with `progressive-delivery`; generic dead-code cleanup stays with `dependency-and-code-hygiene`.
- Per-route LLM token budgets, tail-latency budgets, prompt and response caches, provider-failure degradation paths, and per-feature LLM cost attribution route to `llm-serving-cost-and-latency`; generic backend latency and capacity stays with `performance-and-capacity`; generic spend/reliability tradeoffs stay with `cost-aware-reliability`; generic remote-call retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers stay with `dependency-resilience`.
- Service/module/worker boundary ownership routes to `architecture-decisions`, even when retry policy is mentioned; concrete timeout, retry, idempotency, queue, or overload policy for an existing dependency routes to `dependency-resilience`.
- Repository legibility for AI comprehension, module-boundary maps, code-search-collision checks, function and file-size budgets, and one-tool-call locatability route to `code-readability-for-agents`; macro service boundaries stay with `architecture-decisions`; per-diff pre-merge review stays with `agent-pr-review`.

- New or changed cross-surface data contracts, producer/consumer schema evolution, and domain-interface responsibility route to `data-contracts`; single API contract changes stay with `api-design-and-compatibility`.
- Cache invalidation, derived values, and stale cache entries route to `caching-and-derived-data`; deciding whether stale reads are allowed by the storage model routes to `distributed-data-and-consistency`.
- Data model splits across databases, shards, or mutation boundaries route to `distributed-data-and-consistency`, even when a migration is mentioned; executing schema, backfill, index, or destructive data changes routes to `database-operations`.
- Cross-service workflows whose correctness depends on a database, storage, replication, sharding, or failover route to `distributed-data-and-consistency`; event/message replay, ordering, and DLQ behavior stay with `event-workflows`; in-process state machines, protocols, and concurrency invariants without storage semantics stay with `state-machine-correctness`.
- AI-assisted repo workflow, agent instructions, data boundaries, and generated-code acceptance route to `ai-coding-governance`; deployed LLM app security stays with `llm-application-security`.
- Any specific diff that needs a senior pre-merge review (human, AI, or mixed) routes to `agent-pr-review`; org-level AI coding controls still route to `ai-coding-governance`; generic review routing, responsibility, change size, and DORA workflow do not route unless tied to a concrete engineering surface; explicit launch readiness still routes to `production-readiness-review`; an active incident still routes to `incident-response-and-postmortems` first.
- System-level review rules, change-size limits, review-latency targets, and reviewer routing do not route by themselves; org-level AI coding rules for allowed actions, protected paths, secret/data boundaries, and required verification details route to `ai-coding-governance`.
- LLM tool, prompt-injection, retrieval-boundary, and unsafe-output risk routes to `llm-application-security`; LLM eval datasets, graders, thresholds, and regression checks route to `llm-evaluation`; production ML serving and drift stay with `ml-reliability-and-evaluation`.
- LLM prompt/response storage, session isolation, rollback, and artifact provenance stay with `llm-application-security` only when tied to prompt/retrieval/tool/output boundaries; otherwise route data lifecycle to `privacy-and-data-lifecycle`, tenant boundaries to `tenant-isolation`, rollout sequencing to `progressive-delivery`, and generic supply-chain trust to `software-supply-chain-security`.
- Tenant-boundary isolation proofs route to `tenant-isolation`, even when triggered by an incident; live incident command stays with `incident-response-and-postmortems`.
- Experiments, holdouts, exposure logging, and metric validity route to `experimentation-and-metric-guardrails`; operational canaries stay with `progressive-delivery`.
- Single-surface verification details stay with the matching specialist. `engineering-control-evidence` is for cross-surface control mapping, exception records, scorecards, and control packs.
- Public edge traffic defense routes to `edge-traffic-and-ddos-defense`; internal service-to-service traffic policy routes to `internal-service-networking`.
- Retry, timeout, circuit-breaker, load-shedding, and dependency overload policy routes to `dependency-resilience` even when implemented through internal traffic tooling; service identity, discovery, transport, and locality route to `internal-service-networking`.
- Browser or web client release checks, including field/lab performance signals, loading, interaction readiness, layout stability, runtime errors, payload growth, accessibility smoke, or a concrete UI PR review focused on those checks, route to `web-release-gates`; native mobile rollouts route to `mobile-release-engineering`; backend latency and headroom route to `performance-and-capacity`.
- Headroom and latency without spend tradeoffs route to `performance-and-capacity`; cost, spend, allocation, or reliability/cost tradeoffs route to `cost-aware-reliability`; pure billing work is out of scope.

## Scope

Product discovery, marketing, staffing, compensation, procurement, legal/auditor liaison, and broad compliance-program work are out of scope unless reframed as concrete engineering controls.
