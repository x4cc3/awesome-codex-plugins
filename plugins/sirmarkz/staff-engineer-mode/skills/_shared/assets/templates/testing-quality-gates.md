# Testing And Quality Gates

## Strategy By Risk

| Risk Area | Lifecycle Stage | Required Check | Blocking? | Failure Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Check Matrix

| Check | Pre-Merge | Pre-Release | Launch | Advisory | Measurement Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Critical-Path And Pre-Traffic Checks

| Check | Expected Behavior | Stop Condition | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Test Infrastructure Health

| Environment Or Pool | Capacity Signal | Queue/Wait Signal | Cleanup Or Leak Signal | Failure Classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Distributed-Boundary Failure Matrix

| Boundary | Timeout | Unknown Result | Duplicate | Retry | Server-Side State Safety |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Runtime Budget

| Lane | p95 Runtime Source | Budget | Action When Exceeded |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Gate Integrity Under Cost Pressure

| Slow/Costly Check | Preserved Coverage | Lane Split Or Placement | Bypass Prevention | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Build/Test Cache Correctness

| Cache | Behavior-Changing Inputs | Key/Invalidation Rule | Stale-Output Failure Mode | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Composition And Coverage

| Layer | Count/Ratio | Rationale | Meaningful Coverage Signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Static, Security, And Dependency Policy

| Check | Blocks? | Threshold | Failure Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Test Data Policy

| Data Source | Privacy/Sensitivity Rule | Refresh Rule | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Flake And Legacy Ratchet
