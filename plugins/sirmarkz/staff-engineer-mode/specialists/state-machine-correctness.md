# Systems Correctness And Formal Validation

## Iron Law

```
NO HIGH-STAKES STATE MACHINE WITHOUT MUST-NEVER RULES, MUST-EVENTUALLY RULES, AND COUNTEREXAMPLE CHECKS
```

If you cannot state what must never happen and what must eventually happen, you cannot show that the design handles its critical states.

## Overview

Some bugs are too subtle for example-based tests and too expensive to discover in production.

**Core principle:** express critical correctness properties as invariants, then validate them with the strongest practical combination of model checking, property tests, simulation, fuzzing, runtime checks, and review.

## When To Use

- The user is designing, building, or changing a state machine, protocol, workflow, or concurrency boundary and needs correctness rules before relying on examples.
- The user asks about property-based testing or fuzzing of behavior that crosses a state machine, protocol, concurrency boundary, or trust boundary, where examples cannot cover the input or interleaving space.
- A design includes distributed locks, leader election, consensus, replication, retries with mutation, workflows, money movement, authorization state, or irreversible actions.
- A bug would cause data loss, double execution, cross-tenant access, financial inconsistency, or security boundary failure.
- Tests pass for examples, but concurrency, ordering, timing, crash, or retry interleavings remain uncertain.

## When Not To Use

- The request is normal unit, integration, end-to-end, or CI merge-check design with no state-machine or invariant under test; use `testing-and-quality-gates`.
- The fuzz target is purely a parser, format decoder, or input validator with no protocol or state-machine surface; use `testing-and-quality-gates`.
- The main question is storage choice, database-backed workflow correctness, or consistency semantics; use `distributed-data-and-consistency` unless high-assurance validation of the storage protocol itself is central.
- The main question is retry, timeout, circuit-breaker, or backoff policy rather than correctness of the underlying state machine; use `dependency-resilience`.
- The system is low-risk and ordinary example-based testing is proportional.

## Info To Gather

- Current work phase, next decision, what is known, and assumptions where details are missing.
- State machine, actors, operations, messages, retries, timers, crashes, recovery, and concurrency points.
- Timed leases, grants, locks, heartbeat intervals, expiry thresholds, and reacquisition rules.
- Safety properties: what must never happen.
- Liveness properties: what must eventually happen, and under which assumptions.
- Consistency, idempotency, ordering, durability, authorization, and isolation invariants.
- Unknown-outcome cases where a timeout or lost response means the side effect may have succeeded, failed, or not executed.
- Existing tests, fuzzers, simulations, model specs, incident examples, and known counterexamples.
- Mapping from model behavior to implementation code, logs, metrics, and runtime monitors.

## Workflow

1. **Name the critical property.** Write invariants in plain language before choosing tools.
2. **Model unknown outcomes.** Treat timeout, lost response, and interrupted commit paths as explicit `unknown` states, not as ordinary failures. For side-effecting operations, define what a retry, reconciliation, or user response must do when success cannot be proven.
3. **Model timed ownership.** For leases, grants, locks, or heartbeats, state when ownership remains valid, when it expires, what clients must stop doing after expiry, and how reacquisition avoids duplicate ownership or lost progress.
4. **Bound the model.** Include only state, actors, timing, failures, and nondeterminism needed to test the property.
5. **Choose validation strength.** Match the technique to the invariant. Use property-based testing and fuzzing when the invariant is local and the input or interleaving space exceeds what examples cover; use deterministic simulation when timing, scheduling, crash, or retry interleavings dominate; use model checking when the protocol or concurrency interleaving is the source of risk; reserve formal verification for cryptographic, consensus, or safety-critical mechanisms. Move up the validation ladder when the lower technique cannot cover the state space; do not stop at examples for high-stakes invariants. Example-based distributed-boundary matrices, bounded property tests on pure logic, and parser-only fuzzing with no state-machine or invariant under test belong in `testing-and-quality-gates`. Pin a single recorded seed, support reproducible replay of a failing schedule, and inject faults and clock movement so a discovered interleaving reproduces exactly.
6. **Search for counterexamples.** Treat each failing trace as design feedback, not as a tool nuisance.
7. **Connect model to code.** Record which code paths implement each transition and which tests or monitors check the mapping.
8. **Verify recovery paths.** Include crash, retry, duplicate, reorder, timeout, unknown outcome, lease or grant expiry, partial write, and restart behavior.
9. **Add runtime checks.** Monitor invariants that can be checked in production without leaking sensitive data or harming users.
10. **Re-run on design changes.** Update specs, properties, and generated cases when the protocol or state machine changes.

## Synthesized Default

Use lightweight formal or semi-formal validation for high-stakes stateful behavior. Start with plain-language invariants and counterexample search, then select tools proportional to risk. Do not require formal verification everywhere; require explicit properties where ordinary tests cannot cover the state space.



## Phase Behavior

- Ideation: identify risks, defaults, unknowns, options, and the next decision before code exists.
- Design: shape the target artifact, tradeoffs, checks, and details to gather.
- Development: guide sequencing, code boundaries, checks, and acceptance criteria.
- Testing: define release-blocking tests, evals, fixtures, and failure probes.
- Release: define rollout, observability, abort, rollback, and readiness details.
- Maintenance: define owners, drift checks, cleanup triggers, and refresh cadence.
- Existing artifact: use current code, docs, telemetry, incidents, or diffs as context for the next engineering decision; do not wait for a finished artifact before guiding design, build, release, or operation.
- Missing details: state assumptions and say what to check next instead of blocking lifecycle guidance.

## Exceptions

- Full formal verification may be justified for cryptographic, consensus, safety-critical, or cross-tenant isolation mechanisms.
- Property-based tests may be enough when the state space is implementation-local and failure impact is bounded.
- Deterministic simulation is preferable when implementation timing, scheduling, or crash recovery is the main uncertainty.
- Runtime invariant checks may be sampled or delayed when full checking would harm privacy, cost, or latency.

## Response Quality Bar

- Lead with the invariant set, model boundary, counterexample, validation method, or blocker requested.
- Cover safety/liveness properties, state actors, messages, timing, failures, retries, recovery, code mapping, and runtime checks before optional formal-methods breadth.
- Make recommendations actionable with model scope, properties to test, counterexample handling, recovery cases, checks, and stop criteria where relevant.
- Name the details to inspect, such as protocol states, transition rules, failure assumptions, trace logs, property-test results, simulation output, model checker traces, and code links; do not state details you have not seen.
- Stay technology-agnostic by default: do not introduce provider, product, framework, database, protocol, or command names unless the user supplied them or explicitly requested tool-specific guidance.
- Stay inside correctness validation. Route distributed-data consistency, tenant isolation, or cryptography only when those are the central unresolved risk.
- Be concise: avoid generic formal-methods advocacy and prefer compact property lists, model boundaries, and counterexample tables.

## Required Outputs

- Output shape: render the matching shared template headings or tables in the reply, or use the same shape.
- Correctness property list with safety and liveness split.
- For retry or double-execution scope: an idempotency-key or dedup-token invariant that makes repeated execution safe.
- Unknown-outcome semantics for timeout, lost response, retry, and reconciliation cases.
- Lease, grant, lock, or heartbeat semantics with expiry, stop rule, renewal window, and reacquisition path when relevant.
- State-machine or protocol model boundary.
- Validation method selection and rationale.
- Counterexample log and design changes.
- Code-to-model mapping.
- Recovery/interleaving test plan.
- Runtime invariant or reconciliation plan.

## Checks Before Moving On

- `invariant_list`: critical safety and liveness properties are written in plain, testable language.
- `model_boundary`: actors, state, messages, timing, and failure assumptions are explicit.
- `unknown_outcome`: timeout and lost-response cases define whether the side effect may have happened and how retry or reconciliation stays safe.
- `timed_ownership`: lease, grant, lock, and heartbeat protocols define expiry, stop behavior, renewal, and reacquisition.
- `counterexample_search`: validation attempts to find failing traces and confirm expected cases.
- `sim_reproducibility`: deterministic simulation uses a recorded seed with reproducible replay and injected faults/clock so a failing interleaving replays exactly.
- `code_mapping`: each modeled transition maps to implementation code, tests, or runtime checks.
- `recovery_cases`: duplicate, reorder, retry, crash, timeout, and partial-failure cases are covered or explicitly exempted.

## Red Flags - Stop And Rework

- "Exactly once", "no split brain", or "strong consistency" is asserted without invariants.
- Timeout is treated as proof of failure for a side-effecting operation.
- The model omits retries, duplicate messages, crash recovery, or clock assumptions that exist in production.
- Property tests only replay hand-picked examples.
- A counterexample is dismissed because it is unlikely rather than impossible or risk-accepted.
- Runtime behavior cannot be traced back to the model.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
| --- | --- |
| Modeling the whole system | Model the smallest state machine that protects the invariant. |
| Confusing tests with properties | Write the rule first, then generate or search cases. |
| Ignoring liveness assumptions | State what timing, retry, and failure assumptions allow progress. |
| Letting specs drift | Update model and invariant checks when implementation changes. |
