# Frontend Performance Release Checks

## Iron Law

```
NO CLIENT RELEASE CHECK WITHOUT USER-CENTRIC METRICS, JOURNEY BUDGETS, FIELD/LAB SIGNALS, AND ROLLBACK CRITERIA
```

If a release can make the client experience worse without tripping a check, the check is incomplete.

## Overview

Client-side quality is production reliability for the user's device and network.

**Core principle:** check client-facing releases on field-user experience, journey-level budgets, runtime errors, accessibility smoke checks, and build success.

## When To Use

- The user is planning, building, changing, or reviewing a browser-delivered or client-rendered release that can affect user-perceived loading, interaction readiness, visual stability, runtime errors, payload weight, or client-side release safety.
- You need release thresholds for routes, screens, or user journeys.
- Field-user telemetry, lab checks, deploy markers, feature flags, or automated accessibility smoke checks are needed to stop client regressions from shipping.

## When Not To Use

- The request is product UX strategy, visual design, SEO strategy, or broad accessibility-program management.
- Backend latency is the only issue and client user experience is not central; use `performance-and-capacity` instead.
- The request is general CI check policy; use `testing-and-quality-gates` instead.
- The issue is mobile native release stability; use `mobile-release-engineering` instead.

## Info To Gather

- Current work phase, next decision, what is known, and assumptions where details are missing.
- Critical routes, screens, journeys, user segments, devices, network classes, supported clients, and common client extensions or add-ons that can modify rendered surfaces.
- Field metrics: user-perceived loading, interaction readiness, visual stability, runtime errors, and journey-level latency.
- Lab metrics: payload weight, critical path work, client initialization or rendering cost, dependency weight, and synthetic checks.
- Component-state coverage for variable content, long lists, empty/error/loading states, localization, permissions, and constrained containers.
- Client request targets, base URLs, redirects, embedded script endpoints, and error handling for calls that must leave the customer or document origin.
- Current budgets, deploy markers, feature flags, rollout controls, and rollback path.
- Accessibility smoke checks that can be automated reliably.
- Privacy constraints for real-user monitoring and error collection.

## Workflow

1. **Pick user journeys and routes.** Check user journeys and the application shell.
2. **Set budgets.** Define journey-level payload, JavaScript transfer-and-execution, main-thread / long-task, dependency, critical path, rendering, and interaction budgets.
3. **Use field and lab signals.** Use lab checks for fast pre-merge feedback and field data for real user impact. Set field targets at a high percentile (for example p75 of real users) with a minimum sample size before a "good" verdict is trusted.
4. **Segment enough to see regressions.** Track mobile/desktop, browser, device class, common extension/add-on configurations, geography/network, and key customer segments where relevant.
5. **Exercise component states.** Cover variable content, long lists, empty/error/loading states, localization, permissions, and constrained containers on critical journeys.
6. **Validate request targets.** For browser code, embedded scripts, or SDKs that call service endpoints, verify the generated URL, origin, redirect behavior, and customer-error handling in real document contexts before broad exposure.
7. **Check accessibility smoke checks.** Automate high-signal checks such as missing labels, landmarks, contrast failures detectable by tooling, and keyboard traps where feasible.
8. **Mark releases.** Attach deploy, config, and feature markers to client telemetry and error reports.
9. **Define stop/rollback.** State thresholds for halting rollout, disabling flags, reverting bundles, or forward-fixing, including a per-journey client runtime-error and unhandled-rejection rate threshold (relative to the prior release baseline) alongside loading, interaction, and layout thresholds.
10. **Route backend causes.** If client experience regresses due to backend saturation, follow up with capacity/performance.

## Synthesized Default

Use user-centric journey-level budgets, field monitoring, lab checks, runtime-error tracking, deploy markers, automated accessibility smoke checks, and explicit rollback criteria. Treat client performance regressions as release blockers when they affect critical journeys.



## Phase Behavior

- Ideation: identify risks, defaults, unknowns, options, and the next decision before code exists.
- Design: shape the target artifact, tradeoffs, checks, and details to gather.
- Development: guide sequencing, code boundaries, checks, and acceptance criteria.
- Testing: define release-blocking tests, evals, fixtures, and failure probes.
- Release: define rollout, observability, abort, rollback, and readiness details.
- Maintenance: define owners, drift checks, cleanup triggers, and refresh cadence.
- Existing artifact: use current code, docs, telemetry, incidents, or diffs as context for the next engineering decision; do not wait for a finished artifact before guiding design, build, release, or operation.
- Missing details: state assumptions and say what to check next instead of blocking lifecycle guidance.

## Exceptions

- Low-traffic routes may rely more on lab checks until enough field data exists.
- Accessibility smoke checks do not replace a full accessibility program; they catch release regressions within engineering scope.
- Experimental internal routes can use advisory budgets if isolated from customers.
- Emergency security fixes can ship with narrower performance checks if post-release monitoring and rollback are explicit.

## Response Quality Bar

- Lead with the release checks, blocking thresholds, or rollout decision requested.
- Cover user-centric metrics, journey budgets, field/lab signals, runtime errors, and rollback criteria before optional client quality topics.
- Make recommendations actionable with checks, stop conditions, and rollback or flag actions where relevant.
- For ticketing or release-readiness prompts, separate feature implementation tickets from release-control tickets; if a critical journey already regressed, lead with the hold, flag, or rollback decision before the ticket list.
- Name the details to inspect, such as field telemetry segments, lab checks, deploy markers, error rates, and payload/journey budgets; do not state details you have not seen.
- Stay technology-agnostic by default: do not introduce provider, product, framework, database, protocol, or command names unless the user supplied them or explicitly requested tool-specific guidance.
- Stay inside client release quality. Mention accessibility smoke checks only as release regression checks unless the prompt asks for broader accessibility work.
- Be concise: avoid generic web-performance background and prefer compact check matrices.

## Required Outputs

- Output shape: render the matching shared template headings or tables in the reply, or use the same shape.
- Client runtime SLI/SLO table by journey, screen, or route.
- Performance budget for payload, JavaScript transfer/execution, main-thread/long-task, dependency, critical path, rendering, and interaction costs.
- Client runtime-error budget with a per-journey threshold and rollback trigger.
- Field and lab measurement plan.
- Component-state check matrix for critical journeys.
- Client request-target check for service calls, embedded scripts, redirects, and error handling.
- Client compatibility matrix for browser, device, extension/add-on, and configuration segments that can modify or block rendered surfaces.
- Automated accessibility smoke-check list.
- CI/release check matrix with thresholds and failure response.
- Rollout, flag, and rollback criteria.
- Telemetry privacy notes.

## Checks Before Moving On

- `user_experience_check`: user-centric load, interaction, and visual stability metrics have journey-level targets.
- `budget_check`: payload, dependency, critical path, rendering, and interaction budgets exist with failure response.
- `error_rate_check`: client runtime-error and unhandled-rejection rates have a per-journey blocking threshold tied to rollback, not just tracking.
- `field_lab_check`: both field and lab signals are used or a low-traffic exception is recorded.
- `component_state_check`: critical components cover variable content, long lists, empty/error/loading states, localization, permissions, and constrained containers.
- `request_target_check`: client-generated service calls use the intended origin, path, redirect behavior, and failure handling in real document contexts.
- `client_compatibility_check`: browser, device, common extension/add-on, and client configuration segments that can modify rendered surfaces are covered or explicitly excluded.
- `a11y_smoke`: automated accessibility smoke checks are defined for release regressions.
- `rollback_check`: rollout halt, flag disable, revert, or forward-fix criteria are explicit.

## Red Flags - Stop And Rework

- Build success is the only client release check.
- Aggregate site metrics hide critical route regressions.
- Payload budgets exist but failures have no response path.
- Critical UI components are tested only with happy-path content.
- A common client extension, add-on, or managed configuration can modify rendered surfaces, but the release has no smoke test, telemetry segment, or compatibility exception.
- Field monitoring collects sensitive data unnecessarily.
- Accessibility is treated as fully solved by one automated scan.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
| --- | --- |
| Lab-only confidence | Combine fast lab checks with field user impact. |
| Global budgets only | Set route and journey budgets. |
| No deploy markers | Tag releases, config, and feature flags in telemetry. |
| Happy-path UI checks | Exercise variable content, permissions, and constrained containers. |
| Broad accessibility scope creep | Keep release checks to automated smoke checks and route larger work separately. |
| Tracking errors without a gate | Set a per-journey client error-rate threshold tied to rollback. |
