# Thermal-Fluid Research Workflow Plugin

**A cross-agent research workflow plugin for thermal-fluid mechanical engineering research, proposal development, technical writing, data analysis, research coding, presentations, and AI-assisted workflows.**

This repository packages the `mechanical-engineering-research` skill as a lightweight workflow plugin. The skill remains the domain judgment layer; the plugin adds cleaner install targets and reusable workflow prompts for common research tasks.

**Works with:** OpenAI Codex plugins/skills and Claude Code plugins/skills

## What Is This?

This repository is now a plugin-style distribution for a single canonical skill:

```text
skills/mechanical-engineering-research/
```

The plugin is designed around a simple principle:

```text
academic research workflow = process scaffold
mechanical-engineering-research = thermal-fluid domain judgment layer
```

Use it to help Codex reason more carefully about thermal-fluid research: source quality, physical assumptions, literature synthesis, methodology detail, data-analysis logic, figure discussion, proposal significance, reproducible code, and AI/ML tools connected back to physics.

## Quick Install

### OpenAI Codex

Ask Codex to install the plugin from GitHub:

```text
Install the Codex plugin from https://github.com/hanhuark/mechanical-engineering-research-skill
```

If your Codex environment does not yet support community plugin installation from a GitHub repo, install the skill folder directly:

```text
Install the Codex skill from GitHub repo hanhuark/mechanical-engineering-research-skill, path skills/mechanical-engineering-research.
```

or:

```text
Install the Codex skill from https://github.com/hanhuark/mechanical-engineering-research-skill/tree/main/skills/mechanical-engineering-research
```

Do not ask Codex to install only `mechanical-engineering-research-skill` as a curated skill name. That is the repository name, not a curated Codex skill name.

### Manual Skill Installation

Clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/hanhuark/mechanical-engineering-research-skill.git
cd mechanical-engineering-research-skill
```

Copy the skill into your Codex skills directory:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse .\skills\mechanical-engineering-research "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\mechanical-engineering-research" -Force
```

Restart Codex if the skill is not discovered immediately.

### Claude Code

Claude Code can use the same repository as a plugin because it includes:

```text
.claude-plugin/plugin.json
skills/mechanical-engineering-research/SKILL.md
commands/*.md
```

For local testing, clone the repository and launch Claude Code with the plugin directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hanhuark/mechanical-engineering-research-skill.git
claude --plugin-dir ./mechanical-engineering-research-skill
```

Then invoke the skill or workflow prompts through the plugin namespace:

```text
/thermal-fluid-research-workflow:mechanical-engineering-research
/thermal-fluid-research-workflow:me-lit-review
/thermal-fluid-research-workflow:me-write-section
/thermal-fluid-research-workflow:me-data-analysis
/thermal-fluid-research-workflow:me-build-slides
/thermal-fluid-research-workflow:me-code-review
```

Claude Code should also discover the skill automatically when a task involves thermal-fluid research, mechanical-engineering literature review, manuscript writing, proposal development, research coding, plotting, or presentation planning.

## Usage Examples

### Literature Review

```text
Use the mechanical-engineering-research skill to develop a critical literature review on this thermal-fluid research topic. Synthesize the main theories, methods, limitations, unresolved challenges, and future directions instead of writing a paper-by-paper summary.
```

### Federal Proposal Development

```text

Follow the solicitation structure, map the narrative to review criteria, integrate preliminary results under each thrust, add quantifiable milestones, and cite seminal, recent, and team-relevant papers.
```

### Data Analysis Plan

```text
Use the mechanical-engineering-research skill to design a hypothesis-driven DOE for these experiments or simulations. Start from a baseline case, identify the mechanism being tested, and choose cases that can support or refute the hypothesis.
```

## FAQ

**Is this still a Codex skill?**

Yes. The canonical skill now lives at [`skills/mechanical-engineering-research`](skills/mechanical-engineering-research/). The plugin wraps it with metadata and workflow prompts.

**Why convert it to a plugin?**

The plugin form gives the project a clearer install target, room for workflow prompts, and a path toward future commands, scripts, assets, or additional skills.

**Does the plugin replace academic-research workflow tools?**

No. For full papers and proposals, use academic-research workflow tools as the process scaffold when available. Use this plugin as the thermal-fluid/mechanical-engineering judgment layer.

**Can I use this with Claude Code, Cursor, or other agents?**

Yes for Claude Code. This repository includes `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and the standard `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` structure. Claude Code users can load it with `claude --plugin-dir` or install it through a compatible Claude Code marketplace if listed there. Other agents can adapt the markdown skill manually.

**How should I contribute improvements?**

Add reusable guidance, not one-off facts. Keep `SKILL.md` concise and put detailed workflows in `references/`. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
