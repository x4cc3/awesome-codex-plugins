# OpenAI Docs

Provide authoritative, current guidance from OpenAI developer docs using the developers.openai.com MCP server. Always prioritize the developer docs MCP tools over web.run for OpenAI-related questions. Only if the MCP server is installed and returns no meaningful results should you fall back to web search.

## Quick start

- Use `mcp__openaiDeveloperDocs__search_openai_docs` to find the most relevant doc pages.
- Use `mcp__openaiDeveloperDocs__fetch_openai_doc` to pull exact sections and quote/paraphrase accurately.
- Use `mcp__openaiDeveloperDocs__list_openai_docs` only when you need to browse or discover pages without a clear query.

## OpenAI product snapshots

1. Apps SDK: Build ChatGPT apps by providing a web component UI and an MCP server that exposes your app's tools to ChatGPT.
2. Responses API: A unified endpoint designed for stateful, multimodal, tool-using interactions in agentic workflows.
3. Chat Completions API: Generate a model response from a list of messages comprising a conversation.
4. Codex: OpenAI's coding agent for software development that can write, understand, review, and debug code.
5. gpt-oss: Open-weight OpenAI reasoning models (gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b) released under the Apache 2.0 license.
6. Realtime API: Build low-latency, multimodal experiences including natural speech-to-speech conversations.
7. Agents SDK: A toolkit for building agentic apps where a model can use tools and context, hand off to other agents, stream partial results, and keep a full trace.

## If MCP server is missing

If MCP tools fail or no OpenAI docs resources are available:

**In Codex:**
1. Run: `codex mcp add openaiDeveloperDocs --url https://developers.openai.com/mcp`
2. Restart Codex, then re-run doc search/fetch.
3. If the command is unavailable in the current Codex build, configure the same MCP endpoint through Codex MCP settings, restart, and retry.

**In other agents:** Ask the user to configure the MCP server per their agent's documentation.

## Workflow

1. Clarify the product scope (Codex, OpenAI API, or ChatGPT Apps SDK) and the task.
2. Search docs with a precise query.
3. Fetch the best page and the specific section needed (use `anchor` when possible).
4. Answer with concise guidance and cite the doc source.
5. Provide code snippets only when the docs support them.

## Quality rules

- Treat OpenAI docs as the source of truth; avoid speculation.
- Keep quotes short and within policy limits; prefer paraphrase with citations.
- If multiple pages differ, call out the difference and cite both.
- If docs do not cover the user’s need, say so and offer next steps.

## Tooling notes

- Always use MCP doc tools before any web search for OpenAI-related questions.
- If the MCP server is installed but returns no meaningful results, then use web search as a fallback.
- When falling back to web search, restrict to official OpenAI domains (developers.openai.com, platform.openai.com) and cite sources.

## Examples

### OpenAI API Guidance

**User says:** "How do I use tool calls with the Responses API?"

**What happens:**
1. Search OpenAI docs MCP for "Responses API tools".
2. Fetch the most relevant section.
3. Return implementation guidance with citations.

### Codex Capability Check

**User says:** "Does Codex support read-only review workflows?"

**What happens:**
1. Query Codex docs via MCP.
2. Fetch flag/sandbox references.
3. Answer with source-backed guidance and constraints.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| MCP docs search returns nothing | MCP server not installed | Install `openaiDeveloperDocs` MCP, restart Codex, retry search |
| Results are stale/unclear | Query too broad | Narrow query by product + feature, then fetch exact page section |
| Need citation-ready answer | Source not fetched | Fetch specific doc section before answering |
| Docs do not cover question | Gap in official docs | State gap explicitly and provide safe best-effort guidance |
