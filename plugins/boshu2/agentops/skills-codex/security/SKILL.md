# Security Skill

> **Purpose:** Run repeatable security checks across code, scripts, hooks, and release gates.

Use this skill when you need deterministic security validation before merge/release, or recurring scheduled checks.

## Quick Start

```bash
$security                      # quick security gate
$security --full               # full gate with test-inclusive toolchain checks
$security --release            # full gate for release readiness
$security --json               # machine-readable report output
```

## Execution Contract

### 1) Pre-PR (fast)

Run quick gate:

```bash
scripts/security-gate.sh --mode quick
```

Expected behavior:
- Fails on high/critical findings from available scanners.
- Writes artifacts under `$TMPDIR/agentops-security/<run-id>/`.

### 2) Pre-Release (strict)

Run full gate:

```bash
scripts/security-gate.sh --mode full
```

Expected behavior:
- Full scanner pass before release workflow can continue.
- Artifacts retained for audit and incident response.

### 3) Nightly (continuous)

Nightly workflow should run:

```bash
scripts/security-gate.sh --mode full
```

Expected behavior:
- Detects drift/regressions outside active PR windows.
- Failing run creates actionable signal in workflow summary/issues.

## Triage Guidance

When gate fails:
1. Open latest artifact in `$TMPDIR/agentops-security/` and identify scanner + file.
2. Classify severity (critical/high/medium).
3. Fix immediately for critical/high or create tracked follow-up issue with owner.
4. Re-run `scripts/security-gate.sh` until gate passes.

## Reporting Template

```markdown
Security gate run: <run-id>
Mode: <quick|full>
Result: <pass|blocked>
Top findings:
- <scanner> <severity> <file> <summary>
Actions:
- <fix or issue id>
```

## Notes

- For OWASP A06 dependency vulnerability scanning, run `$deps vuln` to complement static analysis with dependency-level checks.
- Use this as the canonical security runbook instead of ad-hoc scanner commands.
- Keep workflow wiring aligned with this contract in:
  - `.github/workflows/validate.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- For binary/internal black-box assurance plus offline repo-surface redteam, use:
  - `skills/security-suite/SKILL.md` (includes `security_suite.py` and `prompt_redteam.py`)

## Examples

### Scenario: Quick Security Gate Before Opening a PR

**User says:** `$security`

**What happens:**
1. The skill runs `scripts/security-gate.sh --mode quick`, which executes available scanners (semgrep, gosec, gitleaks) against the current working tree and flags high/critical findings.
2. Scan artifacts are written to `$TMPDIR/agentops-security/<run-id>/` for review, and the gate reports a pass/blocked verdict.

**Result:** The gate passes with no high/critical findings, confirming the branch is safe to open a PR.

### Scenario: Full Security Gate for a Release

**User says:** `$security --release`

**What happens:**
1. The skill runs `scripts/security-gate.sh --mode full`, which performs a comprehensive scan including all scanner passes, test-inclusive toolchain checks, and stricter severity thresholds.
2. Artifacts are retained under `$TMPDIR/agentops-security/<run-id>/` for audit trail and incident response, and a structured report is generated.

**Result:** The full gate blocks the release on two medium-severity findings in `cli/internal/config.go`; the operator triages and fixes them before re-running the gate to get a clean pass.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Gate reports "scanner not found" and skips checks | Required scanner (semgrep, gosec, or gitleaks) is not installed | Install the missing scanner: `brew install semgrep`, `go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest`, or `brew install gitleaks`. |
| Gate passes locally but fails in CI | CI environment has additional scanners or stricter config | Compare `$TMPDIR/agentops-security/` artifacts from both environments; align scanner versions and config files across local and CI. |
| False positive blocking the gate | Scanner flags a non-issue as high/critical severity | Add a scanner-specific inline suppression comment (e.g., `# nosemgrep: rule-id`) or update the scanner config to exclude the pattern, then document the suppression reason. |
| Artifacts directory `$TMPDIR/agentops-security/` not created | Script lacks write permissions or `$TMPDIR` is not writable | Verify `$TMPDIR` is set and writable; the script auto-creates subdirectories on each run. |
| Nightly scan not detecting regressions | Nightly workflow is not configured or is pointing at stale branch | Verify `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` runs `scripts/security-gate.sh --mode full` against the correct branch (typically `main`). |
