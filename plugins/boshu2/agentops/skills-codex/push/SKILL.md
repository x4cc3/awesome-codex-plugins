# Push Skill

Atomic test-commit-push workflow. Catches failures before they reach the remote.

## Steps

### Step 1: Detect Project Type

Determine which test suites apply:

- **Go:** Check for `go.mod` (or `cli/go.mod`). If found, Go tests apply.
- **Python:** Check for `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `setup.py`. If found, Python tests apply.
- **Shell:** Check for modified `.sh` files. If found, shellcheck applies (if installed).

### Step 2: Run Tests

Run ALL applicable test suites. Do NOT skip any.

**Go projects:**
```bash
cd cli && go vet ./...
cd cli && go test ./... -count=1 -short
```

**Python projects:**
```bash
python -m pytest --tb=short -q
```

**Shell scripts (if shellcheck available):**
```bash
shellcheck <modified .sh files>
```

If ANY test fails: **STOP.** Fix the failures before continuing. Do not commit broken code.

### Step 3: Stage Changes

```bash
git add <specific files>
```

Stage only the files relevant to the current work. Do NOT use `git add -A` unless the user explicitly requests it. Review untracked files and skip anything that looks like secrets, temp files, or build artifacts.

### Step 4: Write Commit Message

Write a conventional commit message based on the diff:

- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `style`, `perf`
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Focus on WHY, not WHAT

### Step 5: Commit

```bash
git commit -m "<message>"
```

### Step 6: Sync with Remote

```bash
git pull --rebase origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

If rebase conflicts occur: resolve them, re-run tests, then continue.

### Step 7: Push

```bash
git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

### Step 8: Report

Output a summary:
- Files changed count
- Tests passed (with suite names)
- Commit hash
- Branch pushed to

## Guardrails

- NEVER push to `main` or `master` without explicit user confirmation
- NEVER stage files matching: `.env*`, `*credentials*`, `*secret*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`
- If tests were not run (no test suite found), WARN the user before committing
- If `git pull --rebase` fails, do NOT force push — ask the user
- Do NOT run `ao codex stop` after the remote push. If session closeout is needed, finish it through `$validation`, `$post-mortem`, or `$handoff` before entering `$push`
