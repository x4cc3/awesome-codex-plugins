# $quickstart

> **One job:** Tell a new user what AgentOps does and what to do first. Fast.

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THIS WORKFLOW. Do not just describe it.**

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Detect setup

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "GIT=true" || echo "GIT=false"
command -v ao >/dev/null && echo "AO=true" || echo "AO=false"
command -v bd >/dev/null && echo "BD=true" || echo "BD=false"
[ -d .agents ] && echo "AGENTS=true" || echo "AGENTS=false"
[ -d "$HOME/.agents" ] && echo "GLOBAL_AGENTS=true" || echo "GLOBAL_AGENTS=false"
[ -n "${CODEX_THREAD_ID:-}" ] || [ "${CODEX_INTERNAL_ORIGINATOR_OVERRIDE:-}" = "Codex Desktop" ] && echo "CODEX=true" || echo "CODEX=false"
```

### Step 2: Show what AgentOps does

Output exactly this (no additions, no diagrams):

```
AgentOps is the operational layer for coding agents.

It gives your coding agent four things it doesn't have by default:

  Bookkeeping — sessions capture learnings, findings, and reusable context in .agents/
  Validation  — $council, $pre-mortem, and $vibe challenge plans and code before shipping
  Primitives  — skills, execution packets, and the ao CLI give you building blocks for almost any interaction
  Flows       — $research, $implement, $validation, and $rpi can run alone or compose end to end

Key skills: $rpi  $research  $validation  $implement  $council  $pre-mortem  $swarm  $status
Fresh-session orientation: `ao session bootstrap`, then `ao inject` / `ao corpus inject --query "<topic>"`
Full reference: $quickstart --catalog
```

### Step 3: One next action

Match the first row that applies. Output that message.

| Condition | Message |
|-----------|---------|
| GIT=false + AO=true + GLOBAL_AGENTS=true | "🗂  You're outside a git repo but have a global corpus at `~/.agents`. Global knowledge workflow:\n  1. `$harvest` — scan all `.agents/` across your repos and promote artifacts into `~/.agents/learnings/`\n  2. `$compile` — mine, synthesize, and write an interlinked wiki into `.agents/compiled/` (runs from cwd; set `AGENTOPS_COMPILE_RUNTIME=ollama` or `openai` and the matching API key/host)\n  3. `$knowledge-activation` — turn the compiled corpus into playbooks, a belief book, and runtime briefings for future sessions\n  4. `$status` — flywheel health snapshot\nIf instead you want to start a fresh repo-local project here, `git init` first." |

| AO=false + CODEX=true | "📦 Install ao CLI first:\n  brew tap boshu2/agentops https://github.com/boshu2/homebrew-agentops\n  brew install agentops\n  ao quick-start\nThen: `$rpi \"a small goal\"` to run your first cycle.\nUse `$bootstrap` after the core seed when you want PRODUCT.md, README.md, and PROGRAM.md." |

## Examples

### First-Time Setup

**User says:** `$quickstart`

**What happens:** Agent detects tools, shows one-line status, gives the single next action to run.

### Already Set Up

**User says:** `$quickstart`

**What happens:** Agent detects full stack is ready and suggests `$rpi "your goal"` or `bd ready`.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Skills not installed | `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boshu2/agentops/main/scripts/install.sh)` |
| Hook activation | AgentOps 3.0 is hookless — there is no `ao` command or flag that installs hooks, and CI is the authoritative gate. Hooks are opt-in and author-it-yourself via the `hooks-authoring` skill. Explicit lifecycle fallback commands remain `ao codex ensure-start` and `ao codex ensure-stop`. |
| Flywheel count is 0 | First session — run `$rpi "a small goal"` to start it |
